My 3rd year software engineering project.

When I started working I had zero knowledge about DBMS, Java Servlet, MVC design pattern etc, just doing some google and reading some pages of tutorial within a few days I had learned a little and then along with these learning, using my experience of competitive programming and my prior basic Java I came up with this project.
