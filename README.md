My 3rd Year's Software Engineering Project.
Just made within a few days, still I see what I made so far is nothing but a hell lots of bugs only. But this thing saved my 1 credit though :)

when I started working I had zero knowledge about DB, Servlet, MVC etc, just doing some google within a few days I learnt a little and made this buggy thing just to save my 1 credit :D
